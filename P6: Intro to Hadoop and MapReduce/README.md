#### This repository contains the codes of all in chapter exercises and the final project. Lesson 3 was the most interesting lesson to work on and one should sincerely do that lesson to understand MapReduce really better. Final Project is really interesting to work on and one should look at Udacity Discussion Forums for any problem encountered before hoping directly to solution code.
