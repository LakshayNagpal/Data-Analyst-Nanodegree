<p>When you are logged in you should try to find a unregistered ""nickname"" and register it. Once you get that done you can go to #freenode channel and request having a ""Cloak"" applied to your nickname.

<p>I 'm ""expanding"" a bit my blog app, and I came up with the necessity to save a set of values (namely my blog settings) in a place where they could be accessed from every Python module. I came up with the idea of creating a new GAE datastore called Data and save each value as a database tuple. The scheme of the entities looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Data(db.Model):
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    textvalue = db.StringProperty(required=False)
    intvalue = db.IntegerProperty(required=False)
    lastedit = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_add = True)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to store there stuff like the number of posts per page I want in the homepage, the number of written posts (so I don't have to count them each time I need to) and so on.</p>
<p>I'd like to know your opinions on this. Is it a good practice to do such things? Or should I store the values some other way?</p>

"64431"	""	"cs101 "	"100005175"	"<p>I posted <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/60158/feedback-on-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">some feedback</a> which touched on this--I mentioned wanting to really work to be successful--but I'd like to expand on that a bit, here.</p>
<p>I studied math at uni, and if you'd say that a 'weeder course' is one that throws difficult material at students so they must either sink or swim, then nearly all of the classes I took were like this. And because I was able to 'swim', I very much liked the classes being that way, because they forced me to work hard and do my best, and as a result I learnt much more than if the course had moved more slowly in order to ensure that everyone learned the material equally.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were possible to teach the same amount of material, but have more students succeed, then I think that is certainly the right thing to do. But I'm not sure that's always possible. Or, where it is possible, I'm not sure that it's in general within the ability of the professors to do it.</p>
<p>For some online classes like Udacity offers, certainly people may continue trying and studying until they understand, but, realistically, not everyone is going to manage to do it within seven weeks, no matter how well explained or easy the material may be. There may be people who will struggle for seven weeks just trying to understand the first unit. And that's okay, because not everyone must learn at the same rate. But there is not such freedom if you are offering an in-person class at a university.</p>
<p>Basically, we must weigh the benefits of teaching a harder class vs. an easier class. Some people have said before me, here, that if the goal is to teach the most people the most knowledge, then weeding out any people at all is counterproductive. But if resources are scarce--teaching time, for example--then by weeding out a few of the worst performing students, all of the rest might benefit enough that it makes up for it. In a physical university, the people who are weeded out then must take a different class, maybe changing their major or perhaps they will even drop out altogether, and it's a shame, but it would be worse to serve everyone poorly than to serve most better and few poorly or not at all, I think. Certainly people are free to study on their own, but the universities must also limit the resources expended on each student.</p>
<p>The beauty of Udacity, though, is that it can offer classes of comparable difficulty to 'weeder' classes <i>without needing to actually weed out any students</i>. Even if a student is failing every homework assignment, they won't be forced out, and there's no incentive to force them out. So for online classes like this, the value calculus changes. Now you can just teach the best class possible, and continue to iterate until you serve better those who were poorly served at first, because the presence of poorly performing students doesn't hurt those who are performing well. People are free to continue to spend their time trying to learn for as long as they feel it's in their best interests.</p>
<p>So, I think that by all means Udacity should offer courses that are like weeder courses. Throw as much material as possible at students, and see what sticks. But also offer all the explanations and help that are needed to help <i>everyone</i> learn the material. Then, those who can learn the material more easily may continue to have lots of challenging material to study, and those who need more help may get it. And let the path through the course be chosen by the student. Already Udacity is like this--for those students who need no help with the homework, they may choose not to view the 'office hours' videos, and not to request help in the forums. For those who need more help, there are many avenues they may explore. If Udacity continues to build on this, then I think it may combine the best of both options. I hope that it does.</p>"	"answer"	"64092"	"64092"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100005175"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"85102"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>This deals with centripetal acceleration, which is a topic we didn't cover in class. To try to give you an intuitive feel for centripetal acceleration, let's say you are driving a car around a corner. When is it most likely to skid? Well, when you are going fast or when you are turning sharply. This skid out happens because friction can no longer provide the force necessary to keep you moving on your circular trajectory. </p>
<p>Moving in a circle (even at constant speed) is actually a form of acceleration. Remember, acceleration is changing velocity. Since velocity is a vector with both a size (speed) and a direction, you can actually have acceleration if all you are changing is your direction!</p>
<p>For a pendulum, your direction is changing most rapidly as it swings through the bottom.

<p>--- edit ---<br>
So finally I completely revamped the code to (1) remove some bugs and (2) compare more methods. So now the script reliably compares the performance of the following 4 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naive resampling: the simplest and least performing method (in O(n^2))</li>
<li>Naive Binary-search: for each i=1..N, the search is now done with a binary search (complexity is now O(n.log(n))</li>
<li>Wheel: Sebastian's method</li>
<li>Wheel-modified: here, index is initialized at 1 and 2*omega_max is replaced by 2/N</li>

<p>Performance is measured according to 3 types of metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distances: there are 3 of them (1) Sum (A(i) - B(i))^2 ; (2) Sum A(i)*|A(i)-B(i)| ; (3) Kullback divergence(A,B)</li>
<li>Miss rate: the %age of particles that have not survived to the resampling, despite having a &gt;0 importance weight</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sebastian's wheel method seems to perform quite similarly to the Naive-Binary method (which is confirmed by repeating the experience a good many times).<br>
<strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: The modified wheel resampler seems to perform a bit better than the original version: distance with the original omega is lower, it ""misses"" fewer particles (on average 5% less) and is much quicker. </p>
<p>To better understand the meaning of the metrics, I killed the Naive method (too slow) and added a null sampler which simply produces the initial sample (ie the re-sampler distribution is uniform over the initial particle set) ; this should give, for all 3 distance metrics,  a view of what a very poor sampling method does. Here is the outcome for N=50,000:</p>
<pre><code>Omega          |         N |  N * mean | N * stDev |   N * min |   N * max 
               :     50000 |  1.000000 |  1.003655 |  0.000031 | 12.279639

</code></pre>
<p>Again, the modified wheel resampler seems to perform better than the original one from all standpoints.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran the same tests with values for the step that replaces Sebastian's 2*omega_max : alpha/N for alpha=0.5,1,2,3,etc. Clearly, 2/N yields the best performance (best distance and best miss rate) of all tested values. Below is the script's output for alpha=0.5, 1, 2, 4:</p>

<p>Summary of all the specific python stuff learned: <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/file?file_key=agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckcLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMTAxDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNn3FAwLEgxBdHRhY2hlZEZpbGUYmPccDA"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a></p>
<p>So I'm realizing that this is really a very broad range of topics. Knowing basic data structures and control flow, there's a lot of directions. One thing that came to mind was a sudoku solver, which is boring, but not a trivial problem either. The most intuitive thing might be to adapt the web crawler into something more efficient or maybe to find things other than links. Or maybe a really simple cryptography exercise in using hash tables to encode and decode messages.</p>
<p>One thing that I now noticed wasn't covered cause of the way assignments had to be accepted is getting user input. In python it's really simple, if you type out </p>
<p><code>name = raw_input(""Enter your name: "")</code> </p>
<p>the user will be prompted for input and it'll automatically be stored in the variable name. </p>
<p>Kudos to you if you managed to read all the way to this line.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"0"	"(wiki)"	"\N"	"100006877"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"70026"	"\N"	"\N"	"240"	"f"

Your result is something similar to the arithmetic mean (the sum of all elements divided by how many they are). </p>
<p>The median is different, it's the number in the middle, out of the three given numbers (it is used, for example, in some statistics, to estimate the average of something very quickly, without much computing=,</p>
<p>So your code needs to look for the one number out of the three that isn't the biggest nor the smallest. </p>
<p>By the way, the median of, say, five, or any other odd number of numbers is also the number in a middle. If the number of numbers is even, say 6, the median is the arithmetic mean of the middle two.

"65360"	""	"cs101 "	"100008221"	"<p>Why aren't more people using Lisp? Well, I'd give a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, out of habit (er, well, it could be argued that the next two-three ones are also about habit. Oh well). Lisp traditionally was a academic, AI-research language, used where computer resources were less controlled than in the industry. ""A Lisp programmer knows the value of everything and the cost of nothing"", and all that. Lisp systems could afford to waste cycles and memory, since for the AI researchers, the benefit and pure power of expression was the thing. In the industry, computers were used for mundane, repetitive tasks. Lisps expressive power was not needed, and it was too expensive in machine resources. Nowadays, those things are no longer relevant (the Lisp compilers are heaps better, the resources are plentiful, etc) but ""Real systems programming"" is still using languages from the legacy that came from Algol - Pascal - C - C++ and so on. Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM - That kind of thing</p>
<p>Secondly, because writing Lisp is Different(tm). Most computer languages give you a set of blocks, and programming is a matter of putting those blocks together to solve your problem. It is conceptually a bounded environment. Lisp gives you the tools to build your own blocks, and the problem rather becomes one of deciding what blocks would be useful to solve this problem, and then inventing them. What Kilaws talks about when he (?) talks about Lisp being a language to build languages in. It is of course possible to write Lisp programs that mirror more conventional programming styles, but to get to the power of the language, this is where you need to go. And that is a very different way of thinking. The language that is most similar to this style, I think, is Forth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, because the work environment is different. Lisp is (these days) usually programmed interactively and interpreted - A bit like Python, if you use something like IDLE, where you write your code file in one window and test it out at the Python prompt. Only, in Lisp you can do everything from there. You start off writing a few functions to try things out, write a few test cases. Crash out, and interactively debug your code (inspecting variable values at the crash site, back up or go forward, change a function definition in the running program and continue) Identify some common patterns that you abstract into a macro. Load a profiling package that you've written earlier and attach it to your already written functions. Find out that most of the time is spent in two particular functions, so you compile them to get a bit of performance boost. And so on. The functions you've written, the debugger, the compiler - Everything is at your fingers, interactively, at the prompt.  This is also very different, if you're used to the write-compile-test cycle with an external debugger, a compiler that compiles all or nothing, and so on. </p>
<p>Fourthly, because Lisp has so long been a part of academia, there hasn't really been development in the directions that other languages went. A general use language these days has a large standard library, access to GUI tools, stuff like that. It took a long time for Lisp to get these things (insofar as it still has them), because, well...academics... :D The situation is better today, but for a long time it has been behind in the glitz'n'gui departments.</p>
<p>Fifthly (is that even a word?), there is the heretical thought that maybe, just maybe, that power and expressivity isn't all that important in the real world, really. I shudder to write it down, but maybe it isn't really that good? Oh, who am I trying to fool - Of course it is :-)</p>"	"answer"	"64560"	"64560"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"4"	""	"\N"	"100008221"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"86384"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>For example, right now there is a thread concerning HW 4.5, our ""Better Splitter"" HW assignment. You can very clearly identify the difference in thinking in the main issue this thread is concerned about:</p>
<p>Namely, is the SPACE considered a special character? Well, to humans (and non-programmers ;) the space IS special because it represents the LACK of something. But the programmer realizes this is an illusion and that to the COMPUTER, there is no difference other than in a bit pattern. IOW, the COMPUTER simply ""sees"" a space as ANOTHER character (and so does the programmer) but a non-programmer thinks of a space as something being missing.</p>
<p>This is a VERY simple example, but if you go with it for awhile, you'll see that there are literally millions of little things like this that a non-programmer wouldn't consider, but a programmer does. An experienced programmer will not be fooled by these little ""gotchas"" and edge cases and such because she's SEEN them before...she DOES think differently than a non-programmer.</p>"	"answer"	"41246"	"41246"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"2"	""	"\N"	"100004586"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"54476"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Yes, the human body does generate heat. Yes, that heat <em>could</em> be used as a source of energy. But in order to generate heat, the body must be supplied energy (food), and the amount of energy in that food will always be greater than the amount that could be gained from using the heat produced. The aliens should have just used whatever they were feeding the humans as their energy source. Unless I'm forgetting part of the movie.</p>
<p>As to what you said: Charge does flow in our bodies. Small electric fields are created in our bodies. There is energy in these fields. But to create these fields we need to expend more energy than we could reclaim from the field. </p>
<p>Energy transformations are inefficient. The human body is particularly bad. When we want to get some energy from somewhere, we want to transform that energy as few times as possible. </p>
<p>For example, think back to unit 4. A windmill can be used to do mechanical work (like lifting water out of the Netherlands) or it can be used to generate electrical power, which can THEN be converted to mechanical energy. This second option is less efficient than the first, since some energy is ""lost"" to heat in the transformation from mechanical energy (the spinning windmill) to electric energy and then more is lost in the transformation from electric back to mechanical (the turning screw). </p>
<p>Long story short: the matrix is a great movie built on a ridiculous premise. Great question.</p>

"63849"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>In the old days, in London or New York, the gentlemen's clubs were very powerful social organizations.  Those inside -- even if just the nephew of a member -- had powerful advantages over anyone on the outside, no matter what their personal qualities or skills.</p>
<p>Ivy League and world-class universities have functioned in much the same way, though sometimes more subtly.  Success in business has often been a matter of who you know rather than what you know.  Mere technical mastery would relegate you to the working class.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has offered a way to leapfrog into the upper ranks, at least to the extent that the nouveau riche can ever do so.  And computer science has offered a new and easy path to entrepreneurship, for those with chutzpah and entrepreneurial spirit.  Now Udacity and the like are offering an easy path into computer science.</p>
<p>But is that enough to compete with what one finds at Stanford?  In theory, yes.  In practice, I think the answer is ""seldom.""  To put it rather crudely, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear -- nor can you make an entrepreneur out of a computer geek (Bill Gates excepted).  Stanford is in the business of screening out all but the most likely students to succeed, then nurturing them in an environment that demands initiative and expects success.  Some few of those graduates will go on to make major contributions to the endowment fund; hopefully the rest will have useful and satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Udacity certainly has the power to put isolated students on a path to greatness.  (For that matter, so does the Internet.  Or books.  Or a wealthy patron.  Or one good teacher.)  But for typical cases, online education lacks some important elements.</p>
<p>First is the screening.  Large universities use their introductory chemistry classes (or some other difficult course) to weed out the weak, from a student body that was carefully selected to begin with from valedictorians and high school/prep school leaders.  Udacity's CS101 has likewise whittled us down to perhaps as few a 100 students, judging from forum page views, but starting from a less-screened pool.  Yes, Udacity has worldwide reach, and hence will tap brilliance and expertise beyond Stanford's reach.  But still, the output of an online education will typically resemble the input of a Stanford education.</p>
<p>Second is the poor teaching often found at a large research university.  As grateful as we are for Dave's good instruction, let's recognize that Udacity is spoonfeeding us.  A short lecture, an easy quiz, a short test, all with feedback as to the right way to work the problems.  Step by step, we are lead to a packaged conclusion.  It is as if the instructor pulled out a favorite piece of code and spent the next seven weeks stepping us through the modules and statements and concepts.  Yes, it is educational, but in the end we learn only a little beyond that one piece of code.  Any school has to do much the same, but most will require far more book reading and lab work.  Further, bad teaching encourages independent student effort.  Students band into study groups for survival, and must sometimes prepare themselves for the final exam almost in spite of the instructor's efforts to draw them into his/her own research specialty.  The dynamics are complex and different for each class and student, but tend to inculcate social and educational skills you won't get from Udacity forums.</p>
<p>As @charlzz mentioned, there is also the issue of living at home instead of in a dorm.  My father was a professor, so I lived at home as an undergraduate.  It was a mistake.  I needed the experience of living with others of my own age and circumstances.  Not being social, I had little contact with other students outside class.  I remained a nerd.  And my grades suffered as well, though as an individual I was smart enough.  I like to think that I have turned out well, but I know that my poor socialization (originating in grade school and unrecognized ADHD) put me on the wrong path.  I wonder if Udacity isn't offering the same to most of its students.</p>"	"answer"	"63824"	"63824"	"2012-04-12 20:48:21.337582+00"	"1"	""	"200048"	"100005415"	"2012-04-12 21:45:53.014449+00"	"84371"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Usually inverting a matrix can be a cumbersome task if done by hand, but consider that a normal PC will invert a non-sparse matrix of a thousand rows and colums in few milliseconds. Moreover, since the properties of the matrix (i.e. the fact that it is very sparse and that the position of non-zero elements) are well known, it is possible to write very efficient inversion algorithms that will perform only the necessary calculations. You could write an ""inverse_sparse_xy"" method that will correctly operate on the known matrix structure and you'd get back to very efficient.

"10010747"	""	"st101 "	"100007855"	"<p>Dear Ken,</p>
<p>Prof Thrun's and my computation for unit31-5 is as follows :-</p>
<p>Priors probabilities P(T=1)=P(T=2)=P(T=3)=1/3</p>
<p>Here P(T=k) (for k=1,2,3) denote the probability of the True location of the car.</p>
<p>The joint probability P(M=3,T=1)=1/3 (computed as 1/3 * 1),  P(M=3,T=2)=1/6 ( computed as 1/3 *1/2) ,  P(M=3,T=3)=0 ( computed as 1/3 * 0). Here we use the independence of 2 events to multiply their probability. Also we assume the player chooses door 2.</p>
<p>The likelihood, P(M=3|T=1)=P(M=3,T=1)/P(T=1)=(1/3)/(1/3)=1</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=P(T=1,M=3)/P(M=3)</p>
<p>We first compute, P(M=3) = P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1) + P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2) + P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3) =  P(M=3,T=1)+P(M=3,T=2)+P(M=3,T=2) = 1/3 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/2 ( this is what I think Prof. Thrun is computing).</p>
<p>Hence <br>
 P(T=1|M=3) = P(M=3,T=1)/P(M=3) = (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3<br>
 P(T=2|M=3) = P(M=3,T=2)/P(M=3) = (1/6)/(1/2) = 1/3<br>
 P(T=3|M=3) = P(M=3,T=3)/P(M=3) = 0/(1/2) = 0</p>
<p>My computation,using Baye's Rule is like this:-</p>
<p>Prior Probabilities are as above.<br>
Likelihood probabilities:-<br>
P(M=3|T=1) = 1<br>
P(M=3|T=2) = 1/2<br>
P(M=3|T=3) = 0<br>
The above is conditional to the player choosing door 2.<br>
Now we want the Posterior distributions,P(T=k|M=3),k=1,2,3.</p>
<p>P(T=k|M=3) = P(M=3|T=k)P(T=k)/P(M=3) for k=1,2,3. ---(i)</p>
<p>P(M=3)=P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1)+P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2)+P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3)=1.(1/3)+(1/2).(1/3) + 0.(1/3) = 1/2</p>
<p>Hence,by using (i),</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=1.(1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3<br>
P(T=2|M=3)=(1/2)(1/3) / (1/2)=1/3</p>
<p>Now that I typed it out I think both the methods are the same. I would love to hear anyone's thought's on this. To me, Prof Thrun's quick method of dividing by the sum was not obvious,but now I think even he is simply using Baye's Rule.

<p>However, Dave was about to add more code after that loop in order to address the case that keyword wasn't found in index. If he HAD used break instead of return, that index.append([keyword, [url]]) line after the for-loop would have been executed even when the keyword WAS found, which would give a duplicate keyword entry in index. </p>

<p>Your solution is even shorter than my mine -- I like it better. How did you figure out the formulas [:11-d] and [-1-d:]? I'm just wondering if there's any algebra or any shortcut as opposed to what I did -- guess &amp; check.</p>
